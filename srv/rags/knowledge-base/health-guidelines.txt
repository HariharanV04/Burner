 Workplace Health Guidelines

Maintaining good health in the workplace is crucial for long-term productivity, mental well-being, and prevention of health issues. Follow these guidelines to ensure proper workplace health:

 1. Physical Health
- Ergonomic Setup: Ensure your desk, chair, and monitor are set up to maintain proper posture. Keep the screen at eye level and feet flat on the floor.
- Take Breaks: Follow the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.
- Stretch Regularly: Stand, stretch, or take a short walk every hour to prevent stiffness and musculoskeletal pain.
- Hydration: Drink at least 2–3 liters of water daily to stay hydrated and improve focus.
- Proper Lighting: Work in a well-lit environment to reduce eye strain and headaches.

## 2. Mental Well-being
- **Stress Management:** Practice deep breathing, meditation, or mindfulness techniques during breaks.
- **Set Boundaries:** Define clear work-life boundaries to avoid burnout.
- **Take Vacations:** Use leave days to recharge and reduce mental fatigue.
